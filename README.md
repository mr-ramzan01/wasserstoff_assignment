## Understanding the Approach

I started with the smaller task first which has high reusability like the navbar and footer UI. After this, I completed the third page with bubble data visualization statically after that I convert it to dynamically integrated UI with all timeline as well as the zoom in and zoomout features.

And, for the map I tried first with normal map svg and succed in that but the issue was it was not built with the hexagons which was the main task so then I come to know about the h3-js, I explored but didn't come to result then I got to find that the image data can be used in canvas in a way that whenever we hover any part of the image then I got data related to that part only which I think will be useful.

So, I tried a library d3.js which is actually a data driven visualization, I research a lot but not able to fully incorporate what I thought,which was mapping the data image and converting pixelated form into hexagon.

During the assignment I learned a lot of libraries that I never explore before and the data visualization through d3.js which is very vast.
